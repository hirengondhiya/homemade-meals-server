# 1. Description of your website

## 1.1. Purpose

**What is this App about?**

This app offers food lovers a platform to order healthy, authentic home-cooked food prepared by people who genuinely care about cooking. It allows people to buy fresh home-cooked food prepared by professional or hobbyist cooks using the best ingredients. It also provides users to choose from a variety of cuisines and home chefs.

**What are the available choices and what’s wrong with them?**

There are currently three options for people to eat: prepare at home, eat at a restaurant, or order takeaway.

Although cooking food at home seems like the best approach, it may not be suitable for everyone, as people may be busy with their work or other responsibilities. So people tend to go with the other two options. The problem with this is that not all restaurants maintain basic quality standards. We are unknown about the quality of food when we order online through apps. This is deteriorating our health and causing different diseases. Food ordered through takeaway delivery is expensive.

**How are we solving this problem?**

We are introducing the fourth way of ordering food i.e ordering home-cooked food from local people and local chefs made at their home. Our dream is to offer home-cooked high-quality food to everyone who loves fresh and nutritious meals but has no time, skill, or resources to prepare one for themselves. You can finally order healthy and authentic home-cooked food prepared by people who are passionate about cooking with our app. Not only is our food healthy and tasty but it is also cheaper compared to restaurants and takeaways, as our chefs don’t need to pay the rent for the restaurant and are preparing food from the comfort of their home.

**How does it work?**

1. Browse through the list of delicious homemade dishes, prepared by our talented home cooks.
2. Choose a home-cooked meal and put an order.
3. Pick up your meal and enjoy fresh, homemade food, and share your experience with us!

## 1.3. Target audience

We will generally have three targeted audience group:

**College Students and Young Adults:**

This group of people live very fast paced lives. They are busy with their studies, social circles or might be starting a new career. So cooking food at home can be really difficult for them. They will also be missing their home cooked meal when they are living away from home. Our home cooked meal will provide them a taste of their home.

**Parents**

Life of parents with young kids can be very busy. With endless things going around their life, cooking food at the end of the day can be very overwhelming. Buying our home cooked meal will not only give them enough time to spend with their childrens but also, they don’t have to feel guilty of feeding their kids some unhealthy food from restaurants or takeaways.

**Working Professionals**

This group of people are really busy with their work and career. After a long day at work, they don’t like to think about cooking food. So they are more likely to order food from our app, as it gives a healthy option to ordering food from restaurants or takeaways.

Apart from this group, anyone who is passionate about food and would like to taste authentic home-cooked meal would be our target customer.
